How Stripe Integration Works with Supabase
Integrating Stripe with Supabase involves several components working together:

1. Database Schema
The database schema includes:

profiles: Stores user information including their Stripe customer ID
subscriptions: Tracks active subscriptions with status, pricing, and period details
payments: Records one-time payments
products/prices: Optional local cache of Stripe product catalog

2. Edge Function
The stripe-wrapper Edge Function serves as a secure backend for all Stripe operations:

Authentication: Uses Supabase Auth to ensure only authenticated users can make payments
Customer Management: Creates and manages Stripe customers linked to Supabase users
Payment Processing: Handles one-time payments via Checkout Sessions
Subscription Management: Creates, retrieves, and cancels subscriptions
Webhook Handling: Processes Stripe events to keep your database in sync

3. Environment Variables
You'll need to set these in your Supabase project:

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: Your Stripe secret API key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: Secret for verifying webhook signatures
SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: For admin database operations

4. Client-Side Implementation
From your frontend application:

Create a customer: When a user registers
Display products/prices: Show available subscription plans
Process payments: Redirect to Checkout or use Elements for payment collection
Manage subscriptions: Allow users to view/modify their subscription

5. Webhook Processing
The webhook handler automatically:

Updates subscription status (active, past_due, canceled)
Records successful payments
Handles failed payments

Set up a Stripe webhook pointing to your function's /webhook endpoint
Implement the client-side code to interact with the Edge Function
Would you like me to provide a specific example of how to implement the client-side code for a particular use case, such as subscription checkout or managing existing subscriptions?
