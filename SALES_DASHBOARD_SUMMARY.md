# Sales & Billing Dashboard Implementation Summary

## What Was Accomplished
- Created a comprehensive `SalesDashboard.tsx` React component for your CRM.
- Dashboard reports on:
  - Total invoiced amount
  - Outstanding (unbilled) amount
  - Estimated taxes (10% default)
  - Profit and loss (70%/30% split, can be customized)
  - Top clients by invoiced amount
- All reporting is powered by Zustand global state (no backend queries required).
- The dashboard is ready to be imported and rendered anywhere in your app.

## Next Steps for Tomorrow
1. **Integrate the Dashboard**
   - Import and display `<SalesDashboard />` in your main app, dashboard page, or as a new route.

2. **Enhance Reporting**
   - Add more metrics (e.g., invoice aging, average hourly rate, revenue by month).
   - Integrate with chart libraries (e.g., `recharts`, `chart.js`) for visual graphs.
   - Add filters (by date, client, product/service).
   - Pull in more data from other tables (e.g., `invoices`, `payments`, `tax_rates`).

3. **Refine Business Logic**
   - Adjust tax and profit/loss calculations to match your real business rules.
   - Add cost tracking if you want more accurate profit/loss.

4. **UI/UX Polish**
   - Improve dashboard layout and responsiveness.
   - Add export (CSV/PDF) or print options if needed.

5. **Testing & Validation**
   - Test with real data and edge cases.
   - Validate calculations and reporting accuracy.
